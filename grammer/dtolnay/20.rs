Let's work through the functions one at a time.

fn return1

The condition of the if-statement is parsed as a return-expression that returns the value { print!("1") } of type (). The value needs to be evaluated prior to being returned so this function prints 1.

fn return2

This function is parsed the same as return1. The return keyword eagerly consumes a trailing return value, even if the return value begins with a curly brace, and even in the condition of an if-statement where curly braces such as in a struct literal would ordinarly not be accepted. This function prints 2.

fn break1

The condition of the if-statement is a break-with-value expression that breaks out of the enclosing loop with the value { print!("1") } of type (). Similar to return1, in order to break with this value the value needs to be evaluated and this function prints 1.

fn break2

Here we observe a difference between the grammar of break and the grammar of return. Unlike return, the break keyword in the condition of this if-statement does not eagerly parse a value that begins with a curly brace. This code is parsed as:

loop {
    if break {
        print!("2")
    }
    {}
}
We break out of the loop before executing the print, so this function does not print anything.

I believe the reason for the difference between return and break is that returning a value was obviously supported at Rust 1.0 and well before, but break-with-value was introduced fairly late, in Rust 1.19. The code in break2 was perfectly legal Rust code prior to Rust 1.19 so we cannot change its behavior when implementing the break-with-value language feature.

It is possible that a future Edition would adjust the two grammars to align with each other.

The output from main is 121.
