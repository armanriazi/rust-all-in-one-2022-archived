struct S {
    x: i32,
}

const S: S = S { x: 2 };

fn main() {
    let v = &mut S;
    v.x += 1;
    S.x += 1;
    print!("{}{}", v.x, S.x);
}

The semantics of const is that any mention of the const by name in expression position is substituted with the value of the const initializer. In this quiz code the behavior is equivalent to:

struct S {
    x: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let v = &mut S { x: 2 };
    v.x += 1;
    S { x: 2 }.x += 1;
    print!("{}{}", v.x, S { x: 2 }.x);
}
I have simply substituted every mention of S in expresson position with the value of const S which is S { x: 2 }.

The first line of main is equivalent to:

let mut _tmp0 = S { x: 2 };
let v = &mut _tmp0;
The second line of main mutates the value pointed to by v. The same value remains accessible through v for the rest of the lifetime of v, which is why the first character printed is 3.

The third line of main mutates a temporary that immediately goes out of scope at the semicolon. The second character printed is coming from a brand new S { x: 2 }, so 2 is printed.

One additional wrinkle in this code is the concept of namespaces and name resolution in Rust. Any name that refers to a type lives in the type namespace, and any name that refers to a value lives in the value namespace. These are two separate sets of names, and the language is structured such that we can always tell which namespace to look up a name in.

In the context of the quiz code, the name of the struct S is part of the type namespace and the name of the const S is part of the value namespace. That is how we can have seemingly two different things with the same name in scope at the same time.
