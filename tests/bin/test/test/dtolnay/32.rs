This question covers two behaviors of match arms and guards.

First, whether an if guard on a match-arm containing | applies to all alternatives in the match-arm or just to the one it is adjacent to. In the quiz code, does check(x) execute at all for (x, _) or does it only cover the (_, x) case? We would expect 1 would get printed if and only if the former is the case. In fact 1 does get printed. A match-arm gets to have at most one if guard and that guard applies to all the |-separated alternatives in the arm.

But second, this question also covers a kind of "backtracking" behavior of match-arms. After check(x) returns false on (x, _), does the whole match-arm fail to match at that point or does Rust move on to (_, x) and execute the guard a second time? We would expect 2 to be printed if and only if the latter is the case. In fact 2 does get printed; the guard is being run multiple times, once per |-separated alternative in the match-arm.
